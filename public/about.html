<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>This is the most challenging thing I have done ever. 
  Not my type of thing - I am more of a people than PC person .</p>

<p>I started this journey because I felt so helpless whenever we discussed anything 
  website / coding or design wise - I just did not know what any of our developers were talking about. 
I think if you don't know then lots of our ideas are lost in translation. So I took this on - not to become a 
web developer but just so that I am not the dumbest person in the room! Better communication and definately 
taking control of a situation that has caused so many headaches as a small business owner</p>

<p>This is challenging because I still have to do everyhting that I usually do (and I am a wife and mother) so 
  finding the time to do this is tricky - and not easy but I does feel good to take this on. Slowly gettin 
  all the info and piecing the puzzle together.
